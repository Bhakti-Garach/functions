                <h1>Welcome to the Interactive Drink Builder</h1>
                <p>Many people enjoy making cocktails but struggle with knowing which ingredients, glassware and mixers to use for different types of drinks. While cocktail recipe websites exist, they often present static lists without interactivity. Additionally, this new platform could be a more intuitive, visual way to explore drink making and at the same time learn with interactivity. A guided step by step experience would make drink making more accessible and engaging especially for those new to mixology</p>
